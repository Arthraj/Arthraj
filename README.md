About Me 👋
Hello! I’m Arthraj Rathore, a Full-Stack Developer with 2 years of experience crafting robust, scalable solutions across the entire software stack. My journey, rooted in a B.Tech in Computer Science from UIT-RGPV, has evolved into a dynamic career where I bridge cutting-edge frontend technologies like React.js and Next.js with backend systems powered by Node.js, FastAPI, and Python.

🚀 Technical Leadership: At Focdot Technologies, I revitalized a legacy Chrome extension by refactoring its React + FastAPI codebase, slashing user wait times by 65% through asynchronous job queues and real-time synchronization with Amazon Seller Central. Leading a 2-member team, I structured agile workflows, code readability, and resilient API integrations.

🌐 Full-Stack Expertise: My work at Checko.ai and Walkover spans high-performance backend services (handling 1M+ records of database), AI-driven automation, and scalable database architectures using PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and Google BigQuery while reducing aggregation times by 85% through hypertables and cron jobs.

🔧 Innovation & Impact: From building a campus recruitment portal (React + MERN stack) to automating image downloads for 100k+ assets, I thrive on solving complex problems with clean, maintainable code. My projects emphasize seamless user experiences, robust REST APIs, and cross-functional collaboration.

🏆 Achievements: Recognized in hackathons (2nd place at GreenDeck 2022) and coding competitions (Google CodeJam, CodeChef), I balance technical depth with a passion for mentorship and continuous learning.
